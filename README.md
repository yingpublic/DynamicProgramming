Dive into algorithms of Dynamic Programming

## Knapsack without Repetition
### Example: [Take as Much Gold as Possible]
* Input: First line: 10 3 means there are three gold bars and we can only carry 10 units bar. Second line: 1, 4, 8 tells us the weight/value of each gold bar.
* Output: 9 means the maximum.

## String Edit Problem
### Example: [Gene Editing: How many changes to make two strings the same? ]
* Input: First line: short <-means first string. Second line: ports <- means second string.
* Output: 3. (s&- deletion h&p mismatch o&o match r&r match t&t match -&s insertion)

## Change Money Problem
### Example: [Primitive Calculator: How many steps to reach another number by multiply 2, multiple 3, or plus 1?]
* Input: 5
* Output: 3. This means 3 steps to reach from 1 to 5. It can be 1,2,4,5 or 1,3,4,5.
